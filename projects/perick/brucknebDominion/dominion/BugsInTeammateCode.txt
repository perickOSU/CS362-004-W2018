Title:    		Failure to discard.
No.:			SMITHY-2
Class:			FEATURE ERROR
Severity:		MAJOR
Priority:		HIGH

Reported By:	Kruno Peric
Email:      	perick@oregonstate.edu


Product:			Dominion            Version: 	bruckneb-assignment-4b
Platform:   		Linux               Version: 	4.9.0-6-amd64 on Debian 9.
Target Units:	    Smithy Effect, discardCard

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
After playing the smithy card (a call to cardEffect(smithy, ...)), the smithy
card played (located in handPos) should move to the discard pile, thus
increasing the discard count by 1, but it does not get increased and the card
is not moved to the discard pile.


Minimal Example
----------------
set up the (pre) gameState with:

numPlayers = 2
handPos = 2
deckCount = 5
handCount = 5
discardCount = 0

and run:

cardEffect(smithy, 0, 0, 0, &postState, handPos, 0);


Expected Results
----------------
postState.handCount[player]  	= 7
poststate.deckCount[player] 	= 2
poststate.discardCount[player] 	= 1


Actual Results
--------------
Incorrect hand count!
postState.handCount[player] 	= 6

player deckCount mismatch!
poststate.deckCount[player]     = 3

Discard pile did not incease by 1 card!
poststate.discardCount[player] 	= 0


Additional Information
----------------------
The error is routed in the call to discardCard().  This function doesn't 
properly move smithy to the discard pile and increment the count.
